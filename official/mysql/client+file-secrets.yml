# ISSUE
#
# Using file secrets in docker-compose appears broken in docker-compose on SELinux
# Suspect that this is due to docker-compose faking secrets through bind mounts
# but not passing ,z as a mount option.
# The work around is to bind mount our secrets directly with MOUNT_OPTIONS!

version: '3.1'
        
services:
  mysql_cli:
#    secrets:
#      - mysql_root_pass.cnf
    volumes:
      - ../secrets/mysql_root_pass.cnf:/run/secrets/mysql_root_pass.cnf:ro${MOUNT_OPTIONS}

#secrets:
#  mysql_root_pass.cnf:
#    file: ../secrets/mysql_root_pass.cnf
