# ISSUE 01 - Bug in docker/docker-compose
#
# Using file secrets in docker-compose appears broken in docker-compose on SELinux
# Suspect that this is due to docker-compose faking secrets through bind mounts
# but not passing ,z as a mount option.
# The work around is to bind mount our secrets directly with MOUNT_OPTIONS!
#
# ISSUE 02 - Bug in docker/docker-compose
#
# Setting the IMMUTABLE bit via chattr changes ownership of the bind mount to root!
